SACCRDelta.Trade03.Bias04,Trade03.Bias04,"Depending on the valuation model, a CMS swap might be treated as either a linear swap or an option-like product because convexity adjustments can sometimes resemble non-linear payoffs.","You will be given a passage from the regulation, a description of an instrument, and a question.
Your task is to answer the question about the instrument based on the regulation.

Regulation:
52.31
4) For options in all asset classes, T_i is the time period (starting today) until the latest contractual 
exercise date as referenced by the contract. This period shall be used for the determination of the option’s 
supervisory delta in CRE52.38 to CRE52.41.
52.38
The supervisory delta adjustment parameters are also defined at the trade level and are applied to the adjusted notional amounts to reflect the direction of the transaction and its non-linearity.
52.39
The delta adjustments for instruments that are not options and are not collateralised debt obligation (CDO) tranches are defined as follows:
If the position is long in the primary risk factor: δᵢ = +1
If the position is short in the primary risk factor: δᵢ = –1
Footnote:
Long in the primary risk factor means that the market value of the instrument increases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.
Short in the primary risk factor means that the market value of the instrument decreases when the value of the primary risk factor increases.

Instrument description:
A 5-year CMS swap referencing 10-year rates with monthly resets

Question:
Does this instrument require a non-linear supervisory delta?

Return the answer yes or no.
